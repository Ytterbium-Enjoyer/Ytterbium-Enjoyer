Hello, my name is Dawson, and I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge on the world of programming. While I have some experience in C#, C++, and Python, I'm currently focusing most of my attention
on the fields of cybersecurity and game development. Coding has always been interesting to me, as one aspect about myself I've always been proud of is my determination to solve a problem, and solve it
correctly. Whenever I'm working on a large project, I see it in my mind as a puzzle that just needs all the pieces to fit together in the right places, and determining where and what the pieces are makes
me happy every time. I try my hardest, though, to avoid the easy way out whenever possible. Whenever I find a quick and dirty way to go about a problem, I try my hardest to find a cleaner, better solution
that doesn't end up being a potential hazard later on. I'm excited to enter the social and professional landscape of the programming world, and can't wait create amazing things.
